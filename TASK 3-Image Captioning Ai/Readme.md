# Image Captioning Project

This project implements an AI-based image captioning system that combines **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to generate descriptive captions for images. It leverages **pre-trained ResNet50** for image feature extraction and a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** for text generation. The system is designed to efficiently handle large datasets by streaming images from the **MS COCO dataset**.
