Image Captioning Project
This project combines Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to generate captions for images. It leverages pre-trained ResNet50 for image feature extraction and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Transformer-based model to generate captions.

🖥️ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build an AI-based image captioning system that can:

Extract features from images using a pre-trained CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).
Generate captions using an RNN or Transformer-based model.
The dataset used for this project is the MS COCO Dataset (2017), which contains a variety of images with human-annotated captions.

⚙️ Features
Image feature extraction using ResNet50.
Caption generation using an RNN-based or Transformer-based model.
Online image streaming to handle large datasets efficiently.
Proper credit given to datasets and models used.
