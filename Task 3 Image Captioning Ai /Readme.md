# MS-COCO Image Captioning App

This is a Streamlit-based web application that generates captions for images using the BLIP model. The app uses the **Salesforce BLIP Image Captioning** model to predict captions for images uploaded by users.

## How It Works

1. Users upload an image in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.
2. The app processes the image and generates a description (caption) using the BLIP model.
3. The caption is displayed below the uploaded image.

## Requirements

To run this app locally, make sure you have Python 3.8+ and Streamlit installed. You will also need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit transformers pillow torch requests
