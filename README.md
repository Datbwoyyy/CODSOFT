## Tasks
### Task 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses
**Objective:** Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. 
- Use `if-else` statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses.
- Gain a basic understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow.

### Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI
**Objective:** Create an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player.
- Implement algorithms like **Minimax** (with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning) to make the AI unbeatable.
- Learn about game theory and basic search algorithms.

### Task 3: Image Captioning
**Objective:** Combine computer vision and natural language processing to build an image captioning AI.
- Use pre-trained image recognition models like **VGG** or **ResNet** to extract image features.
- Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to generate captions.

### Task 4: Recommendation System
**Objective:** Develop a recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their preferences.
- Use techniques like **collaborative filtering** or **content-based filtering**.
- Suggest movies, books, or products to users.

### Task 5: Face Detection and Recognition
**Objective:** Build an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in images or videos.
- Use pre-trained face detection models like **Haar cascades** or deep learning-based face detectors.
- Optionally, add face recognition capabilities using techniques like **Siamese networks** or **ArcFace**.
